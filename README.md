# Cat Formatter

A simple plugin for the Cheshire Cat that allows you to format the cat's answer by using `html tags` such as `br`, `hr` etc.

# Requirement

## Cheshire Cat AI

To start using the plugin you need to have the Cheshire Cat AI up and running. To do so visit the repository [here](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core) and follow the easy steps to install it.

Once you have setup the `cat`, you need to:

1. Download the plugin from the registry, or the `zip` from the plugin's repository
2. Set the html tag (e.g. `br`)
3. Talk with the cat and see your better answer formatting!
